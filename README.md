# The-Lego-Collector-s-Dilemma-
I am a die hard Lego enthusiast wishing to collect as many board sets as I can. But before that I wish to be able to predict the price of a new lego product before its price is revealed so that I can budget it from my revenue. Since (luckily!), I am a data scientist in the making, I wished to solve this problem myself. This dataset contains information on lego sets scraped from lego.com. Each observation is a different lego set with various features like how many pieces in the set, rating for the set, number of reviews per set ,etc. My aim is to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a set.
